# Iterator Labs

These two labs will have you practice using the `Iterator` and `ListIterator` methods for `ArrayLists`.

* [Lab 1 Instructions](./1.iterator_removeit.pdf)
* [Lab 2 Instructions](./2.iterator_replaceit.pdf)

You will need to complete both the classes.  I have provided you with the sample tests, but I may use additional tests when I check your work.
